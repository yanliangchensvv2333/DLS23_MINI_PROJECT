Overview:
This project aims to train a ResNet model that can obtain high performance of over 90% accuracy with under 5 million trainable parameters. We explored various finetuning techniques from the aspects of architecture and training process to achieve this goal. Specifically, we tried to find a combination of parameter-related hyperparameters in the architecture that led to the highest performance. In the training process, we applied techniques of learning rate decay and data augmentation to further improve the performance. For evaluation, we used our model to perform the classification task on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Results:
Our final model achieved a test accuracy of 92% after 50 training epochs and had 4,918,602 trainable parameters.
